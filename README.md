# Java Projects 🚀

This repository is my collection of Java projects as I learn and practice the language.  
I’m working on new projects every 1–2 days to improve my Java skills in both **theory** and **practical coding**.

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen Java fundamentals.
- Learn OOP, data structures, and algorithms in Java.
- Build small but complete projects.
- Keep track of progress and showcase work.

## 📂 Projects

1. **Calculator App** → Simple calculator using `Scanner`.
2. **To Do List App** → Simple to do list app.
3. _(more coming...)_

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA  
- **Language**: Java (JDK 17 or latest)  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
  
#### ⚡ Made with Java & a hero’s courage

Every project in this repo was forged with **Java**, fueled by **coffee**, and tempered in the fires of **runtime errors**.  
Handle with care: side effects include coding enlightenment and occasional existential dread.
