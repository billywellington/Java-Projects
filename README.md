# Java Projects 🚀

This repository is my collection of Java projects as I learn and practice the language.  
I’m working on new projects every 1–2 days to improve my Java skills in both **theory** and **practical coding**.

## 🎯 Goals

- Strengthen Java fundamentals.
- Learn OOP, data structures, and algorithms in Java.
- Build small but complete projects.
- Keep track of progress and showcase work.

## 📂 Projects

1. **Basics - Hello World** → First Java program.
2. **Calculator App** → Simple calculator using `Scanner`.
3. **Guess the Number Game** → Random number guessing game.
4. _(more coming...)_

## 🛠️ How to Run

- Compile: `javac src/Filename.java`
- Run: `java Filename`
