# Dependency Audit Summary (2025-09-26)

Scope: Audit all dependencies across all package managers in this repository. Report vulnerabilities (IDs, severity, fixed versions) and available updates. Skip/batch majors and note breaking changes.

Repository root: C:\\Users\\billy\\IdeaProjects\\Java-Projects

---

## 1) Package manager manifests discovered

No known dependency manifests were found in this repository. Searched for common files including:
- Java: pom.xml, build.gradle, build.gradle.kts, gradle.properties
- JavaScript/TypeScript: package.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml
- Python: requirements.txt, requirements-*.txt, Pipfile, Pipfile.lock, pyproject.toml, poetry.lock
- .NET: *.csproj, packages.config, Directory.Packages.props
- Go: go.mod, go.sum
- Rust: Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock
- PHP: composer.json, composer.lock
- Ruby: Gemfile, Gemfile.lock

Result: 0 manifests found. This repository currently contains plain Java source/projects without a build tool configuration.

---

## 2) Vulnerability findings

None. No manifests were found, so no third-party dependencies could be resolved or audited.

If/when manifests are added, this section will list each vulnerable package per ecosystem with:
- Advisory ID / CVE
- Severity (CVSS/qualitative)
- Affected range
- Fixed versions

---

## 3) Available updates

None. Without manifests/lockfiles, there are no dependency versions to check for updates.

When manifests exist, this section will include:
- Patch/minor updates available (safe to apply, typically non-breaking)
- Major updates batched and flagged separately with links to changelogs and breaking-change notes

---

## 4) Notes on major versions and breaking changes

N/A for this run. Once manifests exist, major updates will be grouped (batched) and annotated with breaking-change highlights and migration references.

---

## 5) Next steps

- If you plan to adopt a build tool (recommended):
  - For Java, add either Gradle (build.gradle) or Maven (pom.xml). Once present, re-run the audit to surface vulnerabilities and updates.
  - If other ecosystems are added (JavaScript, Python, etc.), the audit script can include them automatically.

- Optional: Use the included helper script (tools\\dependency_audit.py) to run audits locally once manifests are present. It will scan common ecosystems and prepare a similar Markdown summary.
