# Calculator App 🧮

A simple command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) using Java.  
This project was built to practice **user input handling with Scanner**, **control structures**, and **modular code design**.

## 📝 Features Achieved
- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- Input validation for operators  
- Continuous operation until the user decides to quit  
- Clear, reusable methods for each arithmetic operation  
- Friendly welcome and goodbye messages  

## 📖 What I Learned
- Using `Scanner` for user input  
- Writing reusable methods for arithmetic operations  
- Implementing loops for repeated tasks  
- Using `static` variables and methods effectively  
- Designing a simple workflow for user interaction  

## 🌟 Future Improvements
- Implement a **GUI interface** using JavaFX or Swing  
- Add **keyboard shortcuts** for operators  
- Improve **input validation** for invalid numbers  
- Add a **history feature** to store previous calculations
